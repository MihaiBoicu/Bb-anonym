# Compiled by Mihai Boicu based on code created by:
# 2021 July-August
# - David Liu (a1.py, a2.py gc processing)
# - Anish Malik (a3.py - qr processing)
# 2022 March-
# - Anushree Manoharrao (session-key.py - documentation,comments)s
# - Mouhamed Sylla import random, os, and json. Random is used to randomize keys and data. Json is needed to be imported to
#parse the data that we get from the files with the keys and data so it is easier to divey up data and give random numbers to
#keep privacy EX. student data comes in list json makes it an array and moves forward. For the session key there needs to be
#a configurated file to generate keys if there is no file that the file is randomly generated with keys. def load(Self)
#used to open the file and read the data only after this is done the user needs to save the file and then input data
#Once the file is input the data gets allocated and generated for startyear, endyear, lastkey, minstep, maxstep and semster
#following the generate code there is then added randomization code to keep privacy of students lastKey += random.randint(minStep, maxStep)
# finally - Initialize and checks if file exist if does not generates a new data it saves it.
